# Privacy Policy for MD2DOCX

**Last updated:** January 2025

## Overview

MD2DOCX is a browser extension that converts Markdown files to Microsoft Word documents. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our data practices.

## Data Collection

**We do not collect any user data.** MD2DOCX operates entirely within your browser and processes files locally on your device.

### What We Don't Collect:
- Personal information (names, emails, addresses)
- File contents or document data
- Browsing history or website visits
- Usage analytics or statistics
- Location information
- Authentication credentials
- Any other personal or sensitive information

## How the Extension Works

1. **Local Processing Only:** All file conversion happens directly in your browser using JavaScript
2. **No File Uploads:** Your files never leave your device or get uploaded to any server
3. **No Network Requests:** The extension works completely offline and doesn't communicate with external servers
4. **Temporary Memory Usage:** Files are processed in browser memory and immediately discarded after conversion

## Data Storage

- **Local Storage:** The extension may store minimal user interface preferences (such as conversion mode settings) locally in your browser
- **No Cloud Storage:** No data is stored on external servers or in the cloud
- **No Persistent File Storage:** Converted files are downloaded directly to your device and not retained by the extension

## Third-Party Libraries

The extension includes the JSZip library for creating DOCX files. This library:
- Operates entirely within your browser
- Does not transmit any data externally
- Is used solely for the technical process of creating ZIP-based DOCX files
- Does not access or process your personal information

## Permissions

The extension requests minimal permissions:

- **File Access:** Required to read Markdown files you select for conversion
- **Downloads:** Required to save converted DOCX files to your device
- **Active Tab:** Required for the extension popup interface to function

These permissions are used exclusively for the core functionality of file conversion.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Last updated" date.
